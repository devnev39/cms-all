1.  Catering client can edit
    - Item 
    - Coupon Type

    When objects which are maintaining history are made which needs to store the state of the object at the time of transaction
    we need to store the dependency object state as it is in that dependable object.

    Like when placing order - the item state should be saved in the order object. So in order_details table there should be columns
    which will hold item info also. Like name, price, caterer name.

    Also while purchasing a coupon, we have to save the coupon type state into coupon table. So in coupon table we can add columns to
    store the current state of coupontype on which transaction is agreed.

3. JsonBackReference and JsonManagedReference to avoid nesting of json objects.
